# Color Sequence Challenge
Welcome to Color Sequence Challenge! This is a simple web-based game where players test their memory and color recognition skills by reproducing increasingly longer sequences of colors.

# About
This project is the beginning of my journey into web development. It's a small project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice my coding skills and create a fun and interactive game.

# Gameplay
Start the game at level 0.
A color sequence will be displayed, and you need to reproduce it by clicking on the correct colors in the correct order.
Each level increases the length of the color sequence.
Score points for each correct sequence reproduced.
Compete to beat your high score!
